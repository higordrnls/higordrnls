## Hi there 👋

I'm Higor Dornelas — an Architecture & Urbanism student transitioning into tech.

Currently building a path that connects:
architecture, data, and digital environments.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: improving my logic and programming skills
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: algorithms, JavaScript and data fundamentals
- 🎯 Goal: become a Data Architect focused on creating digital spaces and systems
- 🧠 Interests: virtual environments, APIs, data structures, and tech applied to architecture
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: beginner-friendly projects and real-world applications
- 💬 Ask me about: my transition from architecture to tech (still in progress 🚧)
- 📫 How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/higor-dornelas-7935941a3/
- ⚡ Fun fact: I want to build digital spaces like architecture — but inside systems
